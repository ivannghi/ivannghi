## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ivan Nghi, a passionate Software Engineer.

ðŸš€ Hi!

In November of 2022, I decided to step away from the sport of swimming. I left Cal Poly's swim team and a 15-year career in pursuit of a career in software engineering where I can apply myself to building/creating things and do so with other people in a team environment.

In the last few years, I have been studying rigorously at Cal Poly to teach myself the fundamentals of software engineering, building multiple full-stack projects, while maintaining a part-time job as a lead server at a local restaurant. I am a self-starter with a knack for problem-solving, collaboration, and a passion for continuous learning and application.

I love and thrive in uncomfortable situations, thinking about solutions and going the extra mile. I want to create software that solves people's problems and pain points. Recently, I have enjoyed learning and using web development frameworks and tools like Next.js and Typescript.

Let's connect and build the future together! ðŸŒŸ
